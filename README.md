# DaFink UI

A token-driven, accessibility-first design system built on Next.js and Tailwind v4. Components ship as source you own — each one lives in its own folder with implementation, tests, and a machine-readable spec, and is documented on the built-in docs site with a live preview.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev   # docs site at http://localhost:3000
```

## MCP Server

The docs site exposes an MCP endpoint at `/api/mcp` that serves component specs (from each component's `spec.md`), design tokens, and pattern docs. Any AI coding assistant connected to it gets live, always-current component API documentation.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md). Before adding or modifying a component, read the rules in `rules/`:

- `design.md` — visual and motion decisions
- `tokens.md` — how to use design tokens
- `new-component.md` — required file structure for every component
- `docs-site.md` — conventions for the docs site under `app/`
- `commits.md` — commit message format

Accessibility is non-negotiable — every component must be keyboard-navigable, have visible focus indicators, meet contrast minimums, never rely on color alone, and respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
